# CF_ROCKBUSTER STEALTH LLC_Data Analysis Project

**Introduction**

> Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. Hence, my core mission in that project was to use SQL to analyze the data and answer the business questions that the departments may have. 

**Business questions and objectives**

+ Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
+ What was the average rental duration for all videos?
+ Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
+ Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
+ Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

**Project Deliverables**

+ SQL codes
+ Data dictionnary [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hL0h9H9Q_H6vzlrrNJaa3uSSEotHXscWvuF1Gp19hBw/edit?usp=sharing)
+ Presentation with Tableau [Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/m.lissa.tour./viz/RBsmovierentalanalysespresentation/Story1) & Google slides [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hRFn4Ktb3aS_jn7iqNg9w5VZAil8rmUR6tWwUJ3gsFA/edit?usp=sharing)
