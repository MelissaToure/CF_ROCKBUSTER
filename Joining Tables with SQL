Here are some queries I used to join tables regarding buisiness inquires : 

-- Top 10 countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer numbers

Select country, count(customer_id) as total_customer
from customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY count(customer_id) desc
LIMIT 10

-- Top 10 cities that fall within any of the top 10 countries

SELECT COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count,
C.city,
D.country
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_ID
GROUP BY country, city
HAVING country IN ('India',
'China',
'United States',
'Japan',
'Mexico',
'Brazil',
'Russian Federation',
'Philippines',
'Turkey',
'Indonesia')
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

-- Top 5 customers in any of the top 10 cities whoâ€™ve paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster

SELECT SUM(A.amount) AS "total amount paid",
A.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_ID
GROUP BY A.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country
HAVING city IN ('Aurora',
'Acua',
'Citrus Heights',
'Iwaki',
'Ambattur',
'Shanwei',
'So Leopoldo',
'Teboksary',
'Tianjin',
'Cianjur')
ORDER BY "total amount paid" DESC
LIMIT 5
