Here are some SQL queries I used to clean and summarize the data : 

-- Find out duplicates in the film table 

SELECT film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate,
Length, replacement_cost, rating, last_update, special_features, fulltext,
COUNT(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id, title, Description, release_year, language_id, rental_duration, rental_rate,
Length, replacement_cost, rating, last_update, special_features, fulltext
HAVING COUNT(*) >1

-- Find out non-uniformed data in th film table

SELECT DISTINCT film_id, title, description, release_year, language_id, rental_duration,
rental_rate, length, replacement_cost, rating, last_update, special_features, fulltext
FROM film

-- Find out missing data 

SELECT * FROM film
WHERE film_id IS NULL OR title IS NULL OR description IS NULL OR release_year IS NULL
OR language_id IS NULL OR rental_duration IS NULL OR
rental_rate IS NULL OR length IS NULL OR replacement_cost IS NULL OR rating IS NULL OR
last_update IS NULL OR special_features IS NULL OR fulltext IS NULL; 

-- Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical columns in the the film table 

SELECT MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate,
MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate,
AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate,
COUNT(rental_rate) AS count_rental_rate,
MIN(replacement_cost) AS min_replacement,
MAX(replacement_cost) AS max_replacement,
AVG(replacement_cost) AS avg_replacement,
COUNT(replacement_cost) AS count_replacement_values,
MIN(rental_duration) AS min_duration,
MAX(rental_duration) AS rental_duration,
AVG(rental_duration) AS rental_duration,
COUNT(rental_duration) AS count_duration,
MIN(length) AS min_length,
MAX(length) AS max_length,
AVG(length) AS avg_length,
COUNT(length) AS count_length,
COUNT(*) AS row_number
FROM film

-- Calculate descriptive statistics for non-numerical columns in the the film table 

SELECT MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY title ) AS mode_title, MODE() WITHIN GROUP
(ORDER BY description) AS mode_description,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY release_year) AS mode_release_year,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY language_id) AS mode_language,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS mode_rating,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY last_update) AS mode_last_update,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY special_features) AS mode_special_features,
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY fulltext) AS mode_fulltext
FROM film
