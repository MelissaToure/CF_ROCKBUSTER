Here are CTEs I used to answer business inquiries 

-- Average amount paid by the top 5 customers

WITH average_amount_paid AS
(SELECT SUM(A.amount) AS "total amount paid",
A.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_ID
GROUP BY A.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country
HAVING city IN ('Aurora',
'Acua',
'Citrus Heights',
'Iwaki',
'Ambattur',
'Shanwei',
'So Leopoldo',
'Teboksary',
'Tianjin',
'Cianjur')
ORDER BY "total amount paid" DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG("total amount paid")
FROM average_amount_paid

-- How many of the top 5 customers are based within each country

WITH top_5_customers AS
(SELECT SUM(A.amount) AS "total amount paid",
A.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_ID
GROUP BY A.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country
HAVING city IN ('Aurora',
'Acua',
'Citrus Heights',
'Iwaki',
'Ambattur',
'Shanwei',
'So Leopoldo',
'Teboksary',
'Tianjin',
'Cianjur')
ORDER BY "total amount paid" DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country,
COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT (top_5_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers ON A.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
HAVING COUNT (top_5_customers) > 0
ORDER BY (all_customer_count) DESC
